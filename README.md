## Motivation:  :bulb:
 * During the global-pandemic the whole world has gone online.From schools to offices , every aspect of human life has now gone online.So,to properly monitor what an individual is actually doing at the present time , I created  this app.It is reported that many employees who work from home are not actually working the required number of hours that they are required to do.Many of the employees just log-in to the portals and in the background do some personal work (or binge watch web-series!).
In schools and colleges ,students use mal-practices in the online examinations.While giving exams, they would just open another tab/open the browser and search for answers in the web.
At present there is no application that can track whether  the person is actually present in the required apllication or the application is just running in the background.
 My android application targets and solves that issue. By using this app the admin/teacher/examiners can monitor what exactly the employees/students/examinees are doing.
If they try to exit/pause the app then the admin  :guardsman: will immediately get to see which user is offline :sleeping:  and which user  is online :raising_hand: and not only that , the admin will also be able to see their live location on a map :earth_asia:  
How cool is that ? :sunglasses:

## :dart: Key Features:

 - **Live Tracking**: Whenever the user pauses the app , opens another app, presses the home button , and in any other way moves away from the specified  page/activity , then the admin will be able to  see the change in marker color in the map.
Green marker-indicates the user is currently active :raising_hand:
Red marker-indicates the user is away from the activity :zzz:

- :guardsman: **Admin not Trackable** : The Admin's live status will not be reflected in the app , so that the admin can monitor the users correctly.

- :earth_asia: **Location status** -  The Admin will be able to see real-time pin-point location of the user in the map .<br/><br/>
